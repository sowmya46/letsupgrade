Day2 assignment

Phython basic syntax
1)back slash:we use back slash for continuation purpose
Ex:print("hello\\
    World"
Output: hello World

2)Tiple Quote:we have multiple advantage of using Tiple Quote we use for text art and for document string and also we use Tiple Quote for making single quotes.
Ex:for document string
print(""" this is sowmya""")

Output: this is sowmya

3)string inside the quotes:
Ex:print("hello world")
Output:hello world

4)escape sequence of string:
   print("hello \n world")   \n-->newline
Output:hello
              world
print("hello\tworld")
Output: hello world. \t-->tab space

5)formatted output: here we can run multiple statements.
Ex:name="sowmya"
Marks=96
Age=19
print("the person name is",name, "marks is" ,marks, "age is ", age)

Output: the person name is sowmya,marks is 96,age is 19

Phython variable and assignment statement:
Phython variable:
*Variable means linking of the data to a name
*According to the data type the interpreter reserves the memory space
*Variable refers to the memory location that contains the data

Rules to define variable:
*Keywords can't be used as variable
*A variable can contains letter, numbers,underscore
*A variable can't start with a number
*Phython is case sensitive
*Variable is assigning to data by using Assignment operator

Phython assignment statements
<variable name>=<data>
Ex=X=Y=Z=20
EX:x=20.                        y=20
id(x).                                id(y)
(1407569899)               (1407569899)
Here both addesses are same

Phython operators:
1)arithmetic operator
2) comparison operator
3) assignment operator
4)bitwise operator
5) logical operator
6)membership operator
7) identity operator

1) arithmetic operator: these operators are used with numeric values to perform mathematical operations.
Ex:+,-,/,*,//,etc
Ex:x=5
y=5
print (x+y)

Output:10

2) comparison operator:this operator is used to compare the statement values
Ex: x=5
y=10
print(x==y)
The statement is false

3) assignment operator:it is used to assign the values to variables.
Ex:. x=5
print(x)

Output: 5

4) bitwise operator:it is used to compare binary numbers.
|,&,^,<<
Ex:a=200
b=10
a&b

Output:0

Operator precedence:from highest precedence to lowest precedence
Ex:10*5+1*4

Output:19
